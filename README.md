## Our inspiration
Memories and treasures are things that should last a lifetime. Traditionally, a physical time capsule would be buried with physical goods and information and left for years to be unearthed by future people. In the modern world, a digial time capsule can act as a multimedia scrapbook of digital versons of records and momentos. Today, photos and videos are the most common and convenient ways to take a snapshot of history. 

Aced that final? Went to a music festival? Having a bad day and want to cheer your future self up? Record a video documenting your present day experiences and feelings! 

## User requirements 
Android phone running API 29
Access to an SJSU email

## User Guide
Upon entering the app for the first time, the user is presented with the start screen with a Google sign-in button. Users must sign in using their SJSU emails, otherwise they will not be able to use our app. (This is due to organization constraints with our Google Firebase proejct) After logging in, a toast should appear saying the user has successfully logged in and will transition to the home page. 

The home page serves as a landing page for users to "bury" or "unearth" videos to their time capsule. If the user has not buried any videos yet, they will not be able to unearth any videos and the Unearth button will be grayed out.


There is also a log out button for users to sign out of their SJSU account and return back to the home screen.
